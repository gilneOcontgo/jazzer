## What is PhotoGrav Software?
 
PhotoGrav is a software that was developed by CarveWright CNC and has become the industry standard for processing photos for laser engraving. PhotoGrav software allows you to prepare your photos optimally for the laser output and optimize them with regard to the material to be engraved in advance, before you send the file to the laser. PhotoGrav software supports 20 material components such as cherry or walnut wood, transparent, colored or black acrylic plastic, anodized aluminum, a number of leathers, and many plastics with a white or black core. Each of these materials requires different photo editing settings to achieve the best engraver results. PhotoGrav software automatically applies these settings to the photo or image so that you do not have to worry about it. You can also add settings for new materials yourself.

PhotoGrav software also offers advanced enhancements and real-time visual effects that will bring your images to life. You can use the color adjustments tools to modify the appearance of the engraving material, the brightness and contrast controls to adjust the overall brightness and contrast of the material for all colors equally, and the flip tools to flip the images either horizontally, vertically or both. PhotoGrav software also includes a reset to default button which allows you to reset the adjustments to the default setting of the material when you are not satisfied with the results.
 
PhotoGrav software also provides simulations and reports that show you how your photo will look like when engraved on different materials. You can preview your photo on various materials before sending it to the laser. You can also print out a report that shows you the settings and parameters used for each material.
