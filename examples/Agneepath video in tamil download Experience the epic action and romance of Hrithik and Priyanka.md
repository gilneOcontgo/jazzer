## Agneepath Movie Review
 
Agneepath is a movie that pays homage to the original 1990 classic, but also adds its own twists and turns to the story. The movie is a gripping tale of vengeance, betrayal, love and sacrifice, set against the backdrop of the underworld of Mumbai. The movie boasts of stellar performances by the lead actors, especially Hrithik Roshan, who plays the role of Vijay Deenanath Chauhan with intensity and conviction. Sanjay Dutt, who plays the role of Kancha Cheena, the ruthless and bald villain, is equally menacing and terrifying. Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who plays the role of Kaali, Vijay's love interest, adds a touch of charm and humor to the otherwise dark and violent movie. Rishi Kapoor, who plays the role of Rauf Lala, a drug lord and Vijay's mentor, is also impressive and surprising in his negative role.
 
The movie has some memorable scenes and dialogues that will stay with the viewers for a long time. The scene where Vijay confronts Kancha Cheena on his island fortress is one of the highlights of the movie, where both the actors display their acting prowess and charisma. The scene where Vijay recites his father's poem "Agneepath" to inspire his followers is another powerful moment that showcases Hrithik's emotional range and voice modulation. The scene where Kaali proposes to Vijay in a quirky and cute manner is also a refreshing break from the seriousness of the movie.
 
The movie also has some flaws that might disappoint some fans of the original movie or the genre. The movie is too long and could have been edited better to avoid some unnecessary scenes and songs. The movie also deviates from the original plot in some aspects, such as Vijay's relationship with his mother and sister, which might not appeal to some purists. The movie also relies too much on violence and gore to create an impact, which might not suit everyone's taste.
 
Overall, Agneepath is a movie that delivers what it promises: a thrilling and entertaining ride that will keep you hooked till the end. The movie is a tribute to the original masterpiece, but also stands on its own as a modern-day adaptation. The movie is a must-watch for fans of Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt and action movies in general.
